- **Why does `get()` connect `Community 9` to `Community 0`, `Community 1`, `Community 3`, `Community 4`, `Community 5`, `Community 6`, `Community 7`, `Community 8`, `Community 10`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.286) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `emptyState()` connect `Community 8` to `Community 0`, `Community 1`, `Community 3`, `Community 4`, `Community 5`, `Community 6`, `Community 7`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.134) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Are the 10 inferred relationships involving `get()` (e.g. with `me()` and `refresh()`) actually correct?**
  _`get()` has 10 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **Are the 8 inferred relationships involving `emptyState()` (e.g. with `renderPage()` and `renderPage()`) actually correct?**
  _`emptyState()` has 8 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **Are the 8 inferred relationships involving `skeletonRows()` (e.g. with `loadAnnouncements()` and `loadApprovals()`) actually correct?**
  _`skeletonRows()` has 8 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **Are the 2 inferred relationships involving `navigate()` (e.g. with `isLoggedIn()` and `getUser()`) actually correct?**
  _`navigate()` has 2 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **Are the 4 inferred relationships involving `getUser()` (e.g. with `stubView()` and `navigate()`) actually correct?**
  _`getUser()` has 4 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
